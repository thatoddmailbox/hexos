# System requirements
These are for HexOS on a real computer. Not sure why you would want to do this... If you just want to test HexOS, you can use QEMU.
* x86 processor (not sure how old you can go...)
* VGA monitor out (will HDMI work? probably/maybe/perhaps/should be tested)
* CD-ROM drive or HDD (or SSD or ...) to boot from (technically you can boot from a flash drive, but it probably won't be able to find its own files)
* PS/2 keyboard (not sure if a USB keyboard would be emulated by the BIOS or something...) (ok, you could technically maybe use the serial port only, but that's not yet a thing)
* _(optional, but recommended for debugging)_ Serial port
