# System requirements
These are for HexOS on a real computer. Not sure why you would want to do this... If you just want to test HexOS, you can use QEMU.
* x86 processor (not sure how old you can go...)
* VGA monitor out (will HDMI work? probably/maybe/perhaps/should be tested)
* _(optional, but recommended for debugging)_ Serial port
