HexOS is an operating system kernel that, currently, does not do much.

## Things it does do
* Turn on
* Set up interrupts and GDT
* Memory and paging
* Keyboard input
* Probably can multitask (there's code, but nothing really uses it)
* Browse a virtual filesystem
* Mount its own ISO9660 filesystem into that virtual filesystem
